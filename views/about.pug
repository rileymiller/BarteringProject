      |Our project is centered around making the bartering system light and fun. We didn't want to create another clunky Mines website that we are all to familiar 
      |with. We also did not want to cover the experience with a lot of eye-candy to make up for this either. Together we decided to focus on the interaction with the website.
      |Our solution is to create an interesting and fun way to "play" with each item you are interested in.

     h2 New Technology
     p.lead OAuth 2.0
     p
     | One of our new technologies is the use of OAuth 2.0. Essentially, OAuth 2.0 is a system in which you can sign into a certain application, say the Mine Cart,
     | using a different account, such as Google. OAuth 2.0 is widely used because of it's secure method of passing information. Instead of sending passwords
     | or other infromation from one server to another, which could be intercepted and misused, it sends tokens instead. Thus, allowing the safe passing of information
     | between our app and you foreign account.

     p.lead SVG and D3.js
     p 
     | To create our floating boxes, we used a combination of SVG elements and D3.js. SVG, or scalable vector graphics, is used for the creation of the boxes on screen. SVG
     | essentially allows for the creation of shapes and colors that move accross the screen. We also wanted each box to be interacted with and need it to represent data,
     | as well as an actual instance of an item in our database. D3.js is the tool that allows us to do this. D3.js allows us to tether an items data to the box in individual
     | instances. This for instance, allows us to directed you to a page with expanded details of the Item you selected.
